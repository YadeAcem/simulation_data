## Introduction

Potato crops are vulnerable to Synchytrium endobioticum, a fungus causing warts that render yields unusable. Preventing infection is key, often by planting resistant genotypes. However, knowing the present pathotype is crucial. NVWA collected 326 datasets correlating microbiome data to specific pathotypes.
Our developed machine learning model swiftly identifies pathotypes, supplementing time-consuming bio-tests. This tool rapidly and year-round determines S.endobioticum strains, including unknown pathotypes, aiding potato wart management.

## Features


- **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model to identify different pathotypes of S.endobioticum strains based on imported data.

- **Pathotype Identification:** Uses the machine learning model to accurately determine the pathotype of a strain of S.endobioticum, aiding in the management of potato warts.

- **Pathotype Classification:** Classifies different pathotypes of S.endobioticum strains, including those that are currently labeled as unknown, to enhance understanding and management strategies.

- **Rapid Analysis:** Provides rapid analysis capabilities to quickly identify pathotypes, reducing the time required compared to traditional bio-test methods.

- **Season-Independent:** The tool is season-independent, allowing pathotype identification to be performed year-round without dependence on specific times of the year.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool has  a user-friendly interface design to facilitate ease of use and accessibility for users.
